#### Installing and Running the Application

1. Clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/BaloPhilip/camera-app
cd acamera-app
```

2. Install the dependencies. Make sure that you use Yarn 1.0.0 or higher.

```
yarn
```

4. Install the Expo Client app on [your Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent).

5. Launch the project::

```
yarn android
```

6. Scan the QR codes using Expo Client on your Android

If scanning the codes with Expo Client doesn't launch the mobile app, you can manually enter the link to the app:

1. Tap **Explore** in Expo Client.
2. Enter the link similar to this: `exp://000.000.000:19000`. Use your real IP address instead of 000.000.000.

You can look for the link for Expo Client in the console
